# Contributing to OBTF

Thank you for your interest in OBTF.

Before contributing, it’s important to understand what this project **is**—and what it is intentionally **not**.

OBTF is a philosophy-first, low-friction journaling practice.  
Its power comes from restraint.

Most “improvements” make it worse.

## Guiding Principle

**Less structure beats better structure.**

Any contribution that increases:
- complexity
- abstraction
- automation
- configuration
- feature surface area

will almost certainly be rejected.

This is not gatekeeping.  
It’s preservation.

---

## What Contributions *Are* Welcome

Contributions that align with the spirit of OBTF include:

### 1. Documentation Improvements
- Clarifying language
- Better explanations for newcomers
- Typos or wording fixes
- Improved examples that *reduce* confusion

### 2. Philosophy & Rationale
- Thoughtful explanations of *why* simplicity matters
- Essays or notes that strengthen the conceptual grounding
- Clear articulation of boundaries (“what this is not”)

### 3. Workflow Ideas (Lightweight)
- Optional practices that require no tools
- Search strategies
- Reflection habits that fit inside one file
- Ways to *remove* friction, not add it

### 4. Minimal Templates
- Plain-text or Markdown templates
- Examples that lower the barrier to starting
- Anything that fits on one screen

---

## What Will Be Rejected

Please do **not** submit:

- Apps, plugins, or web interfaces
- Databases, schemas, or structured formats
- Required metadata or rigid templates
- Task management features
- Automation-heavy scripts
- “Second brain” frameworks
- Requests to support specific tools (Notion, Obsidian, etc.)

OBTF is deliberately tool-agnostic.

If a contribution requires an explanation longer than the contribution itself, it’s probably too complex.

---

## Issues vs. Pull Requests

### Issues
Use issues to:
- ask clarifying questions
- discuss philosophy
- share experiences using OBTF
- suggest documentation improvements

Do **not** use issues to propose features.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests should:
- be small
- be readable in one sitting
- make the project simpler or clearer
- not introduce new dependencies or concepts

If in doubt, open an issue first.

---

## Tone & Intent

This is a quiet project.

Please keep:
- discussions thoughtful
- language plain
- intent generous
- ego out of it

OBTF is not trying to win mindshare.  
It’s trying to stay usable for a long time.

---

## Final Note

If you find yourself wanting to *expand* OBTF, you may be better served by forking it and building your own system.

That’s not a failure.

That’s how this idea is meant to spread.

**Use the idea.  
Build your own file.**
