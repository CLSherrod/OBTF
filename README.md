# OBTF — One Big Text File Journal

This repository contains my **One Big Text File (OBTF)** journal.

It is exactly what it sounds like:  
one long, living text file that records daily life as it actually happens.

No apps.  
No dashboards.  
No artificial separation between work, health, ideas, money, travel, or meaning.

Just time, written down.

## Why One Big Text File?

Most digital journaling systems optimize for **organization**.  
This one optimizes for **continuity**.

Life does not arrive in neat folders.  
Your mind does not think in categories.  
Memory works by association, repetition, and pattern.

A single chronological file preserves:
- Context
- Causality
- Rhythm
- Drift
- Recovery

Over years, this becomes a ledger of reality—not aspirations.

## What Goes In

Everything that matters *enough to note*:

- Daily events
- Payments and logistics
- Health signals
- Energy levels
- Media consumed
- Conversations
- Travel
- Creative sparks
- Moments of clarity or confusion

Nothing is filtered at the point of entry.  
Filtering happens later—if at all.

## How Tags Are Used (Important)

Tags are **not categories**.  
They are **lenses**.

Most entries are *untagged*.  
Tags are applied only when something rises above the noise.

### Core Tag Types

#### Signal Tags — “This mattered”
Used sparingly.

- `#signal`
- `#pattern`
- `#shift`
- `#warning`
- `#clarity`

These mark moments worth revisiting.

#### Seed Tags — “This wants to become something”
Used when creative potential appears.

- `#essay-seed`
- `#book-seed`
- `#course-seed`
- `#story-seed`

This allows ideas to surface organically without forcing production.

#### State Tags — “What condition was I in?”
Used to track operating conditions, not moods.

- `#low-energy`
- `#clear`
- `#overstimulated`
- `#rested`
- `#fragile`

Over time, these reveal patterns between environment, work, health, and output.

### What Is *Not* Tagged

- Routine tasks
- Obvious logistics
- Daily chores
- Most media consumption

Chronology already handles those.  
Tags exist only to lift meaning *out of time*.

## Weekly Reflection (Optional but Recommended)

At the end of a week, a short reflection may be added:

```markdown
## Weekly Signals
- Body:
- Mind:
- Work:
````

Three lines. No analysis.
Just signal extraction.

## Philosophy

This project follows a few principles:

* **Low friction beats perfect structure**
* **Recording precedes understanding**
* **Patterns emerge from accumulation**
* **Meaning cannot be rushed**
* **One file is harder to lie to**

This is not a productivity system.
It is not a performance tracker.
It is not a public journal.

It is a private instrument for noticing how a life actually unfolds.

## Who This Is For

This approach works best for people who:

* Think in long arcs
* Dislike rigid systems
* Care about energy and attention
* Value truth over optimization
* Want fewer tools, not more

If you need motivation, metrics, or gamification—this is not that.

## License

This repository is shared for reference and inspiration.
The content is personal and not intended for reuse.

Use the idea.
Build your own file.

This README does something most don’t: it **sets boundaries**.  
It explains not just *what* the project is, but *what it refuses to become*.

That restraint is why OBTF works.
