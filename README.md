# OBTF (One Big Text File) Journal

OBTF (One Big Text File) Journal is a simple yet powerful solution for maintaining a journal in Markdown or plain text format. Unlike traditional daily note files, OBTF Journal consolidates all entries into a single text file, with each new day appended to the top of the existing file. 

## Features

- **Single File Storage**: All journal entries are stored in a single text file, making it easy to manage and access your entire journal history.
  
- **Markdown Support**: Write your journal entries in Markdown format for rich text formatting options.
  
- **Plain Text Option**: If Markdown isn't your preference, you can choose to keep your journal entries in plain text format.
  
- **Efficient Organization**: Entries are added to the top of the file, allowing for quick access to the most recent journal entries without the need for navigating through multiple files or directories.
  
- **Customizable**: Tailor your journal entries to suit your preferences, whether it's adding timestamps, tags, or other metadata.

## Getting Started

To start using OBTF Journal, simply follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the OBTF repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/clsherrod/OBTF.git
    ```

2. **Choose Your Format**: Decide whether you want to use Markdown or plain text for your journal entries.

3. **Start Journaling**: Begin adding your journal entries to the main text file (`journal.md` or `journal.txt`). Each new entry should be added to the top of the file. Also, check out 'tags.md' for some tags you can use in your journal.

4. **Customize as Needed**: Feel free to customize the journal format or add additional features to suit your preferences.
