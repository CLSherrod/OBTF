# OBTF — One Big Text File Journal

**A plain-text journaling system built for continuity, honesty, and long-term pattern noticing.**

OBTF is intentionally simple:  
one file, written chronologically, with minimal structure and selective tagging.

No apps.  
No dashboards.  
No optimization theater.

Just a life, recorded as it actually unfolds.

## What This Is

OBTF is a **long-running journal stored as a single text or Markdown file**.

Everything goes in:
- daily events
- work and money
- health and energy
- travel
- media consumed
- ideas
- moments of clarity or confusion

Nothing is filtered on entry.  
Meaning is extracted later—if at all.

This preserves context, causality, and rhythm in a way fragmented note systems can’t.

---

## Why One Big File?

Most systems prioritize organization.  
OBTF prioritizes **continuity**.

Life does not arrive in folders.  
Memory works by repetition and association.  
Patterns only emerge when things are allowed to sit together over time.

A single file makes it harder to lie to yourself.

---

## Who This Is For

OBTF works best if you:
- think in long arcs
- dislike rigid systems
- care about energy, health, and attention
- want fewer tools, not more
- prefer truth over productivity metrics

If you need motivation, gamification, or task management—this is not that.

---

## File Format

- Plain text (`.txt`) or Markdown (`.md`)
- Chronological
- Date-based headings (any format that works for you)

Example:

```markdown
## 2026-01-16
- Paid electrician
- Walked by the water
- Felt unusually clear in the afternoon #clarity
````

That’s it.

## How Tags Are Used (Important)

Tags are **lenses**, not categories.

Most entries are untagged.
Tags are applied only when something rises above the noise.

### 1. Signal Tags — *“This mattered”*

Used sparingly.

* `#signal`
* `#pattern`
* `#shift`
* `#warning`
* `#clarity`

These mark moments worth revisiting.

---

### 2. Seed Tags — *“This wants to become something”*

Used when creative potential appears.

* `#essay-seed`
* `#book-seed`
* `#course-seed`
* `#story-seed`

These allow ideas to surface without forcing production.

---

### 3. State Tags — *“What condition was I in?”*

These describe operating conditions, not moods.

* `#low-energy`
* `#clear`
* `#overstimulated`
* `#rested`
* `#fragile`

Over time, these reveal correlations between health, environment, work, and output.

---

### What Is *Not* Tagged

* routine chores
* logistics
* obvious context
* most media consumption

Chronology already handles those.
Tags exist only to lift meaning *out of time*.

---

## Weekly Signal Extraction (Optional)

At the end of a week, you may add a short reflection:

```markdown
## Weekly Signals
- Body:
- Mind:
- Work:
```

Three lines. No analysis.
This trains the journal to think upward, not just forward.

---

## Recommended Tools

OBTF works in any editor:

* Obsidian
* iA Writer
* VS Code
* Vim
* Any plain-text editor

Search is your primary interface.

---

## What This Is Not

* Not a productivity system
* Not a task manager
* Not a database
* Not a public journal

It is a **private thinking instrument**.

---

## Contributing

This repository is shared for inspiration, not standardization.

Useful contributions include:

* workflow ideas
* tag philosophy improvements
* scripts that respect simplicity
* documentation clarity

Feature bloat will be rejected.
