# OBTF — One Big Text File Journal  
*A minimalist plain-text journaling system for long-term thinking, pattern recognition, and honest self-study.*

OBTF (One Big Text File) is a journaling and personal knowledge practice built around a single idea:

**Keep your life in one chronological text file.**

No apps.  
No databases.  
No dashboards.  
No optimization theater.

Just continuity.

## What Is OBTF?

OBTF is a **plain-text journaling method** where everything goes into one long file, written in chronological order.

It is used to record:
- daily life events
- work and creative output
- health and energy signals
- travel and environment
- money and logistics
- ideas, insights, and questions
- moments of clarity, fatigue, or change

Nothing is filtered at the point of capture.  
Meaning is extracted later—if at all.

## Why One Big Text File?

Most note-taking and PKM systems fragment life into folders, tags, and databases.

OBTF does the opposite.

A single file preserves:
- context
- cause and effect
- rhythm
- recovery
- long-term patterns

Memory works through repetition and proximity.  
OBTF respects that.

---

## Who This Is For

OBTF is especially useful if you:
- prefer plain text over apps
- think in long arcs instead of daily goals
- care about energy, health, and attention
- dislike rigid productivity systems
- want fewer tools, not more
- value truth over optimization

If you’re looking for a task manager, habit tracker, or productivity app, this is not it.

---

## File Format

OBTF works in:
- `.txt`
- `.md`

Markdown is recommended but optional.

Entries are chronological and date-based.

Example:

```markdown
## 2026-01-16
- Walked by the water
- Paid electrician
- Felt unusually clear in the afternoon #clarity
````

That’s enough structure.

---

## Tag Philosophy (Critical)

Tags in OBTF are **lenses**, not categories.

Most entries are **untagged**.
Tags are applied only when something rises above the noise.

### Signal Tags — “This mattered”

Used sparingly.

* `#signal`
* `#pattern`
* `#shift`
* `#warning`
* `#clarity`

These mark moments worth revisiting later.

---

### Seed Tags — “This wants to become something”

Used when creative potential appears.

* `#essay-seed`
* `#book-seed`
* `#course-seed`
* `#story-seed`

This allows ideas to surface organically without forcing output.

---

### State Tags — “What condition was I in?”

These describe operating conditions, not moods.

* `#low-energy`
* `#clear`
* `#overstimulated`
* `#rested`
* `#fragile`

Over time, these reveal correlations between health, environment, and work.

---

### What Is *Not* Tagged

* routine chores
* obvious logistics
* most media consumption

Chronology already handles those.
Tags exist only to lift meaning *out of time*.

---

## Weekly Signal Extraction (Optional)

At the end of a week, you may add:

```markdown
## Weekly Signals
- Body:
- Mind:
- Work:
```

Three lines. No analysis.

This turns the journal from a record into a pattern detector.

---

## Recommended Editors & Tools

OBTF works anywhere you can edit text:

* Obsidian
* VS Code
* iA Writer
* Vim / Neovim
* Any plain-text editor

Search is the primary interface.

---

## What This Is Not

* Not a productivity system
* Not a task manager
* Not a database
* Not a public journal

OBTF is a **private thinking instrument**.

---

## Contributing

This repository is shared for inspiration and adaptation, not standardization.

Useful contributions include:

* workflow ideas
* tag philosophy refinements
* lightweight scripts
* documentation improvements

Feature bloat will be rejected.

## License

Shared openly for reference and remixing.
The journal content itself is personal and not intended for reuse.

**Use the idea. Build your own file.**
